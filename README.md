# B4-study
These Python programs are designed to perform data analysis studies on my solar wind velocity model, the "DCHB model".
They require the following observation data as input. 
However, we do not have those observation data in this repository.
  - solar wind velocity observed by the IPS radio telescope
  - photospheric magnetic field observed by the telescopes (KPVT/SPM, SOLIS/VSM, GONG)
  - coronal magnetic field calculated by the PFSS model
  - extreme ultraviolet images of coronal holes observed by the satellites (SDO/EIT, SOHO/HMI).

My original implementation is as follows
  - A program that executes the DCHB model to calculates solar wind velocity from the 3D structure of the coronal magnetic field by the PFSS model and outputs a color map.
  - A program that calculates statistical parameters taking into account the area expansion effect associated with a 360 x 180 orthogonal grid of latitude and longitude is pasted on a spherical surface (the same as the area distortion at high latitudes in the Mercator map).
  - A program that reduces the resolution of the data by performing convolution with a kernel that can keep the same shape on the sphere.
  - A program that determines the DCHB model parameters that have the highest correlation coefficient with the IPS solar wind speed through a full search.
  - A program that produces a scatter plot of the solar wind speed versus distance from the CHB from the results of statistical parameter calculations.
